\section{Other information}
Monk has 312 phobias. The strongest of these phobias are: germs, dentists, sharp or pointed objects, milk, vomiting, death and dead things, snakes, crowds, heights, fear, mushrooms, and small spaces. In addition, new phobias develop at seemingly random intervals, such as a temporary fear of blankets.\\
Due to his overpowering fear of germs, Monk refuses to touch door handles and other common objects with his bare hands, avoids contact with anything dirty, and always uses sanitary wipes after human contact, including basic handshakes. He is also unable to eat food that other people have touched.
